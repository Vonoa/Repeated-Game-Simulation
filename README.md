# Repeated-Game-Simulation
This looks at Repeated Games from Game Theory, and looks at the best strategies to win in a repeated Game.  
Their are 3 games here:
  1. Player V Player
  2. Player V Computer
  3. Computer V Computer
The Computer V Computer one looks at the performance of different startergies against each other and exports the file to a excel file where u can then graph and analyse the trends.
The Stratergies for Computer V Computer are:
  1. computer_stratergy_random which randomly chooses between betrayal or cooperation
  2. computer_stratergy_always_betray which always betrays
  3. computer_stratergy_always_cooperate which always cooperates
  4. computer_stratergy_tit_for_tat which follows what the opponent does
  5. computer_stratergy_C where it is a version of tit for tat but will sometimes go to betray at random.
  6. computer_stratergy_D where it is a version of tit for tat but will sometimes go to cooperate at random.
  7. computer_stratergy_Xc is a version of random but holds bias to cooperation
  8. computer_stratergy_Xb is a version of random but holds bias to betray
